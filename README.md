<h1>Hi there, I'm Ksusha! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5080574/182417516-4288dece-7b78-445d-93b1-7e3dd3a65a2d.gif" width="32px"></h1>

🐾 I have 10 years of engineering experience, specializing in web development. My skill set includes expertise in HTML/CSS, Javascript, design, and animation.

🫶 I love taking static designs and turning them into visually appealing and highly intuitive UIs. I enjoy integrating animations and micro-interactions to enhance the user experience. Feel free to check out my experiments on my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/kotAndy).

🎓 I have also successfully completed a UX/UI course at the British Higher School of Art and Design, which has given me the ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with interface designers.

📚 Moreover, I've been actively learning iOS development for the last year, and I already have my own app on the AppStore: [Hizo: Habit Tracker & Todo](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1668034074). Please don't hesitate to reach out and let me know what you think.

🐳 In my spare time, you'll often find me immersed in books, playing Animal Crossing, or walking through beautiful places.
